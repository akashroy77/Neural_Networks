# Neural_Networks
The code is for single layer Neural Network, multi-layer Neural network and convolution neural
network model, performed on Fashion-MNIST dataset. Here in the first part we are building a single hidden layer
neural network to train our data. This is implemented in python from scratch. In the second part we are building a
multi-layer Neural Network with open-source neural-network library, Keras. For the third part we are
building Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with open-source neural-network library, Keras. At the end
we are calculating Loss, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix for each classifier and observing the relative strengths
and weaknesses.
